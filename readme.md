# Typescript Testing

I am learning how to use typescript, right now I have met the requirements and will attempt to create more complex code.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install node.js
2. Run the app.js (typescript is compiled to javascript before running)

Instructions for using the software:

1. There is not user input (currently)

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Install VSCode and node.js

## Useful Websites to Learn More

This was the most helpful website for learning typescript:

* [typescriptlang handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add more classes
* [ ] Embed the typescript (javascript?) into html
* [ ] Obfuscate the code
